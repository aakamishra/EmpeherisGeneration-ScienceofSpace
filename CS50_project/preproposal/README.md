# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking of making a web app that allows a user to figure out where the stars are in the sky based on their current location. Another one I was thinking of is making an app that allows you to do the same thing but uses the camera to figure out what you are looking at.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I had talked to some of my firends but it seems like we all have our own ideas so I am working alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

What is the level of difficulty that we have to demonstrate with this project, do we have to incorporate everything we learned this year?
