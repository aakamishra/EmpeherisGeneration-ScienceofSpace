# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Web-based Application for Astronomical Modeling and Ephemeris Generation

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The website will be able to pull live data from NASA and display positions of planetary objects in the night sky as well as allow users to upload pictures of planets, stars etc..

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Essentially using astropy and the JPL Horizons database the website will use the live orbital values to generate a graphic on the website that displays the current location of certain astronomical objects. This will be based on the longitude and latitude of the user. The user will also be able to query the website to find descriptions and viewing tips as well as be able to upload their own pictures as well. This will be accomplished via a querying program through python, website tools created via JS and the website design and function which will be written in HTML and CSS. The website will allow users to access their own computer files and upload those files to the website where they will be displayed when an object is queried on the website.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N\A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will be able to complete and design a web app that allows users to query and view live locations of astronomical objects in the night sky no matter what happens.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Web-interface,
Database Query Portal,
Graphical live-View,
Website Design


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will be to have all of the mentioned features and be able to optimize the design of the website so that queries can be optimized for upload time and also the website would have the ability for people to upload their own astronomy pictures.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn about how I will be able to present a live graphic on a website, how to pull data in a loop from a database, how to create a storage space for pictures on a website or database where those pictures will be uploaded and then later queried, and also how to create a good looking website because I have never made a website before. I will need to learn how to create graphics on a website including displaying video and pictures, as well as animations for any models I would need to display as well. Moreover, I am not well-versed in HTML, CSS and JS and so this will be a learning experience for me to try to learn these languages and integrate and utlize their unique features for my website. Step wise, I am first going to make a skeleton of a website with the basic functionaility and integration with any tools I plan on using. Then I am going to add features as time goes on and as I learn the basics I need for programming web-apps to make the website design look better. Finally, after functionality and design are fully implemented, I will try my best to optimize features of my website for users as much as possible before the deadline.
